when we click on input field then keyboard opens up which reduces the phone screen size
resizeToAvoidBottomInset:false
✅ Keyboard opens
✅ UI stays same
✅ Gradient does NOT move

in login page
when input field is pressed the password is not visible as i kept resizeToAvoidBottomInset
as the bottom conatiner is scroble we need to have extra spae which makes it scrollable
so we use padding
 padding: EdgeInsets.only(
                      bottom: MediaQuery.of(context).viewInsets.bottom,
                    ),
 we add extra space at bottom so it will scroll
 MediaQuery tells the height,width,If keyboard is open
 so viewInset means screen area coverd by system UI
 ViewInset.bottom - > How much of the bottom of the screen is covered by system UI


 for any pressable button we can use elevatedbutton and we can give use style by keeping it
 in sizedBox and we can style it by style:ElevatedButton.styleForm(


layoutBuilder means we can get the costraints like height,width based on the parent widge
and it must return a widget

builder:function that creates  a widget
like LayoutBuilder(
       builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
         // You can use constraints here to calculate sizes
         return Container(
           width: constraints.maxWidth / 2,
           height: 50,
           color: Colors.blue,
         );
       },
     )
List.generate(itemcount,(index)=>{
"Item ${index}"
}

List.generate(itemcount,(_)=>{
"hi"
}
we keep _ when we dont need or dont care about _

key helps flutter identfies the widget


borders
inputDecoration:enabledBorder:OutlineInputBorder( borderRadius:BorderRadius.circular(10),
                                                                                     borderSide: BorderSide(
                                                                                         color: Colors.black54
                                                                                     ),
               focusedBorder(

IN graphql we can call differenct endpoints t a time and get the data
